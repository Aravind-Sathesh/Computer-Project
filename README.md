# Computer-Project

This is a repo for the calculator, units converter and algebra solver program that we're doing for our computer project.
This features extensive unit support , with over 50+ units (guesstimating here) and easy and fast conversion between them.

The calculator part of it also features an expression solver , and a calculator core , the outputs of which can be sent to the converter and vice versa.
It supports all kinds of math operations and uses the 'sympy' library offered by python.

TThis can be used to speed up pesky chemistry , physics and mathematics calculation with an easy to use text interface
