# Computer-Project

This is a repository for the calculator, units converter and algebra solver program that we're doing for our computer mini-project.

The unit converter features extensive unit support, with over 50+ units in various different standrads, with easy and fast conversion between them. This output can be further converted or used for calculations.

The calculator part of it also features an expression solver, and a calculator core, the outputs of which can be used for further calculations or sent to the units converter.
It supports all kinds of math operations and uses the 'sympy' library offered by python.

This can be used to speed up pesky physics, chemistry and mathematics calculations with an easy to use text interface.
